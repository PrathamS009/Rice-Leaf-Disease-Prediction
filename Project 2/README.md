# Rice Leaf Disease Prediction - Project 2
This is Project 2 of the Rice Leaf Disease Prediction series, where we used a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to classify rice leaf images into different categories. The project is deployed as a Streamlit web application for easy access and usage.
<br>
## Project Details
  - Model Used: MobileNetV2 (Pre-trained on ImageNet)
  - Libraries Used:
    - TensorFlow
    - Keras
    - Streamlit
    - Pillow (PIL)
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib
    - Pickle (for saving training history)
  - Model Saving:
    - The trained model is saved using TensorFlow/Keras.
    - The training history (loss, accuracy graphs) is saved using Pickle for future analysis and visualization.
## ðŸ“¥ How to Run Locally:
  - Run "streamlit run "RiceLeafDisease_PreTrained_WebBased.py" in Python terminal
