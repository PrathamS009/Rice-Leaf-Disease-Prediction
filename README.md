# Rice Leaf Disease Prediction 🌾

Welcome to the **Rice Leaf Disease Prediction** project!  
This project aims to develop an AI-based solution for detecting diseases in rice leaves using images. 🌱✨

To build this project step-by-step and explore different approaches, it has been **divided into 4 sub-projects**:

---

## 📂 Project Structure:

- **Project 1:**  
  🔹 Build a **machine learning model from scratch**  
  🔹 Deploy the model using a **basic Streamlit web application**  

- **Project 2:**  
  🔹 Use a **pre-trained deep learning model** (transfer learning)  
  🔹 Deploy using a **Streamlit web application**  

- **Project 3:**  
  🔹 **Dockerize** the Streamlit application  
  🔹 Make it easier to deploy and run anywhere using **Docker containers**  

- **Project 4:**  
  🔹 Develop an **Android application**  
  🔹 Integrate the model so users can click a picture and get real-time predictions on their phone 📱

## 🚀 Goal:

- Help farmers and researchers quickly identify rice plant diseases
- Practice Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Docker, and Mobile App Development
- Learn full-cycle project development from **data to deployment**

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies:

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- **Streamlit** (for creating web apps)
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Android Studio / Java or Flutter** (for mobile app development)

---

## 📈 Future Improvements:

- Expanding the dataset  
- Improving model accuracy  
- Building a complete backend for Android app
